<h1>Welcome to Travel Away Airlines</h1>
<p>Travel Away Airlines has come a long way since our founding in 1972, evolving from a regional airline to one of the most respected travel brands around the world. We fly one of the youngest aircraft fleets in the world to destinations spanning a network spread over six continents, with our Singapore Girl as our internationally-recognisable icon providing the high standards of care and service that customers have come to expect of us.

We have made a habit of leading the way, and along the way developed a reputation for being an industry trendsetter. Our ever-growing list of industry-leading innovations includes the following firsts:</p>
<ul>
   <li> First to offer free headsets, a choice of meals and free drinks in Economy Class, in the 1970s </li>
    <li>First to introduce satellite-based inflight telephones in 1991</li>
    <li>First to involve a comprehensive panel of world-renowned chefs, the International Culinary Panel, in developing inflight meals in 1998</li>
